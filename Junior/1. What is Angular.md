Can you explain what Angular is and why it is commonly used in web development?


Angular is a **TypeScript-based** framework designed by Google. It's commonly used for building **single-page applications (SPAs)** because it provides features like **data binding**, **dependency injection**, and **component-based architecture**, which simplify the development process.
