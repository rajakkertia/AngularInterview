**What is Angular’s `ChangeDetectionStrategy`, and how does it impact performance?**


**Change detection** in Angular is the process that keeps your app's UI in sync with its data. It checks for changes in the component's data and updates the DOM accordingly.

Angular provides two **ChangeDetectionStrategy** options:

1. **Default**: Angular checks the entire component tree every time there’s a change (e.g., input changes, events, or async calls). This can be resource-intensive for large apps.
    
2. **OnPush**: Angular only checks a component and its children when:
    
    - An **@Input** value changes.
    - An event is triggered from within the component.
    - A reference to an object or array changes.

### Why is it important for performance?

- **Default** strategy works well for smaller apps but can slow things down in larger apps because it checks the entire tree frequently.
- **OnPush** improves performance by reducing the number of checks, making it ideal for components where data doesn’t change often or comes from immutable sources.

Example of using `OnPush`:

<script>
import { ChangeDetectionStrategy, Component } from '@angular/core'; 
@Component({ 
selector: 'app-my-component', 
templateUrl: './my-component.component.html', 
changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush, }) 
export class MyComponent {}
</script>

With `OnPush`, Angular skips unnecessary checks, relying on you to notify it when to update.
