**What is Angular’s `Router`, and how does it help in building single-page applications (SPAs)?**


The **Angular Router** is a powerful tool that lets you define routes to navigate between components in a **single-page application (SPA)**. It allows you to map a URL to a specific component, so when users visit a certain route, the corresponding component is displayed without reloading the page.

### Key Features:

1. **Route Configuration**: You define routes in the `app-routing.module.ts` file, associating paths with components.
2. **Dynamic Navigation**: Users can navigate between components based on URLs, links, or programmatic navigation.
3. **Guards**: You can protect routes with tools like `AuthGuard` to control access.
4. **Lazy Loading**: Load specific modules only when a route is accessed, improving performance.

### Example:

1. **Define Routes**:
<script>
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component'; 
import { AboutComponent } from './about/about.component'; 
const routes: Routes = [ 
{ path: '', component: HomeComponent }, 
{ path: 'about', component: AboutComponent }, 
]; 
@NgModule({
imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)], 
exports: [RouterModule], 
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}
</script>
2. **Use Links in Templates**:
<script>
<a routerLink="/">Home</a> 
<a routerLink="/about">About</a> 
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
</script>
The `<router-outlet>` is where the routed components are displayed.

3. **Programmatic Navigation**:
<script>
constructor(private router: Router) {} 
goToAbout() { 
this.router.navigate(['/about']);
}
</script>

This makes SPAs fast and seamless because the browser doesn’t reload the entire page—only the relevant component.
