**What are Lifecycle Hooks in Angular? Can you list a few common hooks and briefly explain their functions?**

### What are Lifecycle Hooks?

Lifecycle hooks are **special methods** in Angular that allow you to tap into different phases of a component’s life, such as when it’s created, updated, or destroyed. These hooks help you manage logic at specific points in the component's lifecycle.

### Common Lifecycle Hooks:

1. **`ngOnInit`**:
- Called **once** after the component is initialized.
- Commonly used to initialize data or make API calls.
<script>
ngOnInit() { 
console.log('Component initialized'); 
}
</script>

2. **`ngOnChanges`**:

- Called whenever **@Input() properties** change.
- Useful for responding to input changes from a parent component.
<script>
ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
console.log('Input properties changed:', changes); 
}
</script>

3. **`ngAfterViewInit`**:

- Called after the component’s **view (HTML)** and child views are fully initialized.
- Useful for DOM manipulations or third-party libraries.
<script>
ngAfterViewInit() { 
console.log('View fully initialized'); 
}
</script>

4. **`ngOnDestroy`**:

- Called just before the component is destroyed.
- Commonly used to clean up resources like unsubscribing from observables or removing event listeners.
<script>
ngOnDestroy() { 
console.log('Component destroyed'); 
}
</script>

### Why Are Lifecycle Hooks Useful?

They give you control over **when and how to run specific logic** in a component’s lifecycle, ensuring your app runs efficiently.
