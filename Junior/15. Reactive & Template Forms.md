**Can you explain what `Reactive Forms` are in Angular and how they differ from `Template-Driven Forms`?**


In Angular, there are **two ways** to build forms: **Reactive Forms** and **Template-Driven Forms**. Both help you create and manage forms, but they work differently.

### **Template-Driven Forms**

- Forms are built **in the HTML template** using directives like `ngModel`.
- They rely on **Angular's two-way data binding** to track form changes.
- Simpler and better for smaller, less complex forms.
<script>
<form #myForm="ngForm"> 
<input name="username" ngModel required />
<button [disabled]="myForm.invalid">Submit</button> 
</form>
</script>
The form's structure and validation rules are defined **directly in the HTML template**.


### **Reactive Forms**

- Forms are built and managed **in TypeScript code** using `FormGroup` and `FormControl`.
- More flexible and powerful for handling **complex forms**.
- Validation is defined programmatically.
<script>
import { Component } from '@angular/core'; 
import { FormGroup, FormControl, Validators } from '@angular/forms'; 
@Component({ 
selector: 'app-reactive-form', 
template: ` <form [formGroup]="myForm"> <input formControlName="username" /> <button [disabled]="myForm.invalid">Submit</button> </form> `, 
}) 
export class ReactiveFormComponent {
myForm = new FormGroup({ username: new FormControl('', Validators.required), });
}
</script>
Here, the form’s structure and validation are managed in the **TypeScript file**, making it easier to test and extend.

### Key Differences:

|Feature|Template-Driven Forms|Reactive Forms|
|---|---|---|
|**Setup**|Defined in the HTML template|Defined in TypeScript|
|**Validation**|Declarative (via directives)|Programmatic (via Validators)|
|**Use Case**|Simple forms|Complex, dynamic forms|
|**Testing**|Harder to test|Easier to test|

### Which One to Use?

- Use **Template-Driven Forms** for small, simple forms where you don’t need much flexibility.
- Use **Reactive Forms** for larger, more complex forms with advanced validation or dynamic controls.
