**What is Dependency Injection (DI)?**


Dependency Injection is a **design pattern** that Angular uses to provide dependencies (like services, objects, or values) to components, directives, or other services. Instead of creating instances of these dependencies manually, Angular’s DI system **automatically supplies them when needed**.

### Why is it important?

1. **Reusability**: You can write a piece of code (e.g., a service) once and reuse it wherever it’s needed.
2. **Maintainability**: Makes your code cleaner and easier to test by separating responsibilities.
3. **Flexibility**: You can change dependencies without modifying the components that use them.

### Example of DI with a Service

1. **Create a Service**:
<script>
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; 
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root', }) 
export class DataService { 
getData() { 
return 'Hello from DataService!';
} 
}
</script>

2. **Inject the Service into a Component**:
<script>
import { Component } from '@angular/core'; 
import { DataService } from './data.service'; 
@Component({ 
selector: 'app-example', 
template: `<p>{{ message }}</p>`, 
}) 
export class ExampleComponent { 
message: string; 
constructor(private dataService: DataService) { 
this.message = this.dataService.getData();
} 
}
</script>
Here, `DataService` is injected into the component’s constructor, and Angular takes care of creating and providing the instance.

### How DI Works in Angular:

1. **Providers**: Tell Angular how to create an instance of a dependency.
2. **Injectors**: The mechanism Angular uses to supply the dependencies.
3. **Tokens**: Angular uses tokens to look up the dependencies.

In short, DI helps you write modular, scalable, and testable applications by separating concerns and avoiding repetitive code.
