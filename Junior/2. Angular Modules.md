**What is the purpose of Angular modules, and how do they help structure an application?**


Angular modules, or **NgModules**, help **organize and structure an application** by grouping related components, directives, pipes, and services together. This makes the application more **maintainable** and allows you to easily **reuse functionality** across different parts of the app. The root module, usually called `AppModule`, bootstraps the application, while feature modules can encapsulate specific functionality.

For example, a **user management module** could handle user-related components and services separately from other parts of the application.
