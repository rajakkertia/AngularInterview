**Can you describe the difference between a component and a directive in Angular?**


In Angular, **a component is a type of directive**, but with a template attached. Hereâ€™s a clearer breakdown:

1. **Component**: A building block of the UI, it combines logic, data, and a template (HTML) to define how a part of the application looks and behaves. Components are used to structure an application into smaller, reusable parts.
    
2. **Directive**: A directive is a broader term. While components are a type of directive, there are **structural directives** (e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`) and **attribute directives** (e.g., `ngClass`, `ngStyle`). These are used to modify the DOM or behavior of elements without providing a full template.
    

For example:

- A **component** might represent a user profile card with its HTML and logic.
- A **directive** might dynamically hide or style that card.
