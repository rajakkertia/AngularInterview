**What is two-way data binding, and how does Angular implement it?**


Two-way data binding allows **synchronization** between the data in the TypeScript class (the model) and the view (the HTML). If the variable in the class changes, the view updates automatically, and vice versaâ€”changes in the view are reflected in the class.

In Angular, **two-way binding** is achieved using the `[(ngModel)]` directive, which combines property binding (`[value]`) and event binding (`(input)`).

For example:

<script>
<input [(ngModel)]="name" /> <p>Hello, {{ name }}!</p>
</script>

In this case, if you change the input, the `name` property in the class is updated, and the paragraph reflects the new value immediately.
