**Can you explain what services are in Angular and how they are used with dependency injection?**

**Services in Angular** are classes designed to handle **shared logic** or functionality across the application, such as making **API calls**, managing **state**, or performing **data transformations**. They allow you to keep your components focused on presenting data rather than handling business logic.

Services are typically provided to components using **dependency injection (DI)**. Angularâ€™s DI system makes it easy to inject a service into a component, directive, or another service by including it in the constructor.

Example:

**Create a service**:
<script>
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root', }) 
export class ApiService { 
constructor(private http: HttpClient) {} 
getData() { return this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data'); }
}
</script>

2.**Use it in a component**:

<script>
@Component({ ... })
export class MyComponent {
			data: any; constructor(private apiService: ApiService) {}
			ngOnInit() {
			this.apiService.getData().subscribe((response) => {
			this.data = response;
			});
		}
	}
</script>

This keeps the API logic in the service, while the component focuses on displaying the data.
