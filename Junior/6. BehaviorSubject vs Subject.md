**What is the difference between `BehaviorSubject` and `Subject` in RxJS, and when would you use each?**

Think of **Subject** and **BehaviorSubject** as ways to pass messages between different parts of your app.

1. A **Subject** is like a walkie-talkie. If someone starts listening **after** you’ve said something, they miss the message. It’s only useful if you’re already listening when the message is sent.
    
2. A **BehaviorSubject** is like a TV channel. Even if you turn on the TV late, you’ll see the last thing that happened (the current show). It remembers the most recent message and shares it with anyone who starts listening, even if they join late.
    

So when do you use them?

- Use a **Subject** if you don’t need to save or replay the last message. For example, when you send a one-time event, like "Hey, I clicked this button!"
- Use a **BehaviorSubject** when you want new listeners to get the latest message right away, like the current user’s name or app settings.
