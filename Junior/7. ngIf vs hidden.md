**What is the difference between `ngIf` and `hidden` in Angular, and when would you use each?**

Imagine you want to show or hide something on your web page, like a message. Both `ngIf` and `hidden` can help, but they work differently:

1. **`ngIf`**: Think of it as magic that makes something **appear or disappear** completely. If the condition is false, Angular **removes it from the page**. It’s like it was never there. If the condition becomes true, it adds it back.

<script>
<p *ngIf="showMessage">Hello, this is a message!</p>
</script>
If `showMessage` is `false`, the `<p>` tag is completely gone from the page.
2. **`hidden`**: This **hides the element** but doesn’t remove it. The element stays in the page (invisible), but it’s still there in the background, like a secret note under your desk.
<script>
<p [hidden]="!showMessage">Hello, this is a message!</p>
</script>

1. If `showMessage` is `false`, the `<p>` tag is hidden, but it’s still part of the page.
    

When to use them:

- Use **`ngIf`** if you want to **completely remove** something to save memory or avoid unnecessary calculations.
- Use **`hidden`** if you just want to **hide it temporarily** but still need it in the background.

**`ngIf`** is an **Angular directive**, so it’s specific to Angular and doesn’t exist in plain HTML. It’s written with the `*` syntax because it’s a structural directive that modifies the DOM by adding or removing elements.

**`hidden`**, on the other hand, is a **native HTML attribute**. It’s not an Angular directive—it’s part of standard HTML. Angular can bind to it using property binding (`[hidden]`), but the attribute itself belongs to HTML.

For example:

- **`ngIf`**: Specific to Angular, removes the element completely.
- **`hidden`**: A native HTML attribute that hides the element visually but keeps it in the DOM.
