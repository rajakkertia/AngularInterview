**Can you explain what lazy loading is in Angular and why it’s useful?**


**Lazy loading** in Angular means loading modules or components **only when they’re needed** (like when you navigate to a specific route). This helps improve the app's **performance**, especially for large applications, by reducing the amount of code loaded at the start (initial load).

Why it’s useful:

- It **saves resources** like memory and network bandwidth by not loading unnecessary parts of the app upfront.
- It makes the app **faster to load** for users because only essential features are loaded initially.

Example: In your `app-routing.module.ts`, you can set up lazy loading for a feature module:

<script>
const routes: Routes = [ { path: 'feature', loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule) } ];
</script>

This way, the **FeatureModule** is loaded only when the user navigates to the `/feature` route.
