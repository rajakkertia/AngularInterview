**What is the purpose of Angular’s `HttpInterceptor`, and how can you use it?**

An **HTTP Interceptor** in Angular is like a gatekeeper for all your HTTP requests and responses. It allows you to **modify, handle, or log** requests before they are sent to the server and responses before they reach your app.

### Why is it useful?

- Adding **authentication tokens** (e.g., a JWT) to every request.
- Logging or debugging all HTTP traffic.
- Handling **errors globally** (e.g., redirecting to a login page on `401 Unauthorized`).
- Showing a **loading spinner** during HTTP calls.

### Example:

Here’s how you can use an interceptor to add a token to all outgoing requests:

1. **Create the Interceptor**:
	<script>
		import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; 
		import { HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest, HttpHandler } from '@angular/common/http';
		 
		@Injectable()
		 export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor { 
		 intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler) { 
		 const token = 'your-auth-token'; 
		 const clonedRequest = req.clone({ 
		 setHeaders: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
		  }); 
		  return next.handle(clonedRequest); } }
	</script>
2. **Provide the Interceptor** in `app.module.ts`:
		<script>
		import { HTTP_INTERCEPTORS } from '@angular/common/http';
		 providers: [ 
		 { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: AuthInterceptor, multi: true },
		  ],
		</script>
	Now, every HTTP request will include the `Authorization` header.
